Note that the script provided by DeepMind allows to run the datapipeline in a CPU node by using `--norun_inference`, and the GPU step with `--norun_data_pipeline`. 

If you do this, the json file that is output of the first step is the input for the second!! Be careful with overwriting and deleting the MSA information.
